# college-rankings-forbes-2019

A data visualization project for 2019 College Rankings by Forbes.

BasicGraphs codes for visualizing the data as is, plotting different data columns (i.e. undergraduate population, net price, etc.) vs college ranking. Each plot also includes a trendline calculated with a linear regression model.

KMeansClustering applies a k-means clustering method to the data that we have graphed in BasicGraphs. The outputted graphs indicate the clusters as well as the calculated centroids.
